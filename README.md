# Inverted-Pendulum
Arduino hobby project

The project consists of salvaging and reverse engineering a linear carriage and rotary encoder from an inkjet printer (HP in this case) and using them to build an inverted pendulum. 

The project is currently in the state that I left it a year ago. I did not use git at the time so first thing to do is clean up the project structure and the project files.
